## Projects Overview

1. **Image Classification with CNNs**
   - Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying images from popular datasets such as CIFAR-10 and MNIST.
   - Includes data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation metrics.

2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Sequence Prediction**
   - Developed RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs for time-series forecasting and sequence-based classification problems.
   - Explored different types of RNN architectures to handle sequential data effectively.

3. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
   - Created GANs to generate new data samples that resemble a given dataset.
   - Included hands-on experience with training both the generator and discriminator models, along with loss function analysis.

4. **Transfer Learning for Image Recognition**
   - Applied transfer learning techniques using pre-trained models like ResNet and VGG to solve image recognition tasks.
   - Focused on fine-tuning and feature extraction to achieve better performance with fewer resources.

5. **Natural Language Processing with Transformers**
   - Implemented Transformer models for NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and text summarization.
   - Learned attention mechanisms and how they enhance model performance for text-related applications.
